### AES-256 Encryption Standard 
![AES-256 Encryption Standard](https://parmeetsinghghai.github.io/psgdrivesync/assets/img/feature1.png)

Use Advanced Encryption Standard to Encrypt All Your Files and Folders On Local and Remote Drives. Doing so Makes Sure That Your Files and Folders Remain Secure and Protected.

Here is a quote from the [Wikipedia pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) on AES Encryption: 
> "The National Security Agency (NSA) reviewed all the AES finalists, including Rijndael, and stated that all of them were secure enough for U.S. Government non-classified data. In June 2003, the U.S. Government announced that AES could be used to protect classified information:The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm (i.e., 128, 192 and 256) are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level. TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths. The implementation of AES in products intended to protect national security systems and/or information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use." 

### Conditional Automated Syncing

Create Filters Based On Time, Date, File Properties etc to Automatically Filter and Sync Files. You Can Setup "Filters" Based On
- Current Date & Time
- Drive Properties Like Name, Total Space, Available Space etc
- File Properties like Name, Size, Hash, Last Modified Time etc
- Folder Properties like Name, Last Modified Time, Type etc
Which Can Help You Sync Only Specific Files and Folders Thus Giving Your More Control Over The Automated Sync Process 

### Real Time File Operations
